# Lumira the Goddess of Light
----
Lumira is said to be the creator of life and source of joy. She also is the Goddess of beauty, kindness, light, warmth, fire, fertility, prosperity, health, and love. Nearly everyone prays to Lumira at times. The cold pray for warmth during the winter, the lonely pray for love, and those in darkness pray for light. However, Lumira is not adored by all. Some harbor hate in their heart and have great disdain for Lumira, they view fires as Lumira's uncontained excitement.	

During particularly joyous times, but very rarely, Lumira may appear to spread joy and light. When she does, she often manifests herself as a dove or a beautiful woman. She is the most beautiful of the Gods. 

Lumira loved Palovo.

**Domains:**	Light, Life

# Palovo the God of Peace
----
The keeper of peace, father of nature, curator of knowledge, and ambassador of fairness, Palovo is almost universally adored. Wizards and academics worship Palovo and pray for assistance in the pursuit of learning. Druids and farmers pray to Palovo requesting aid in communing with nature. Judges and Kings may look to the teachings of Palovo to guide their understanding of justice and fairness.
 
The laws of mortals were supposedly written by Palovo himself, however this idea is mainly touted by those in power and not widely believed by the people. It is said that Lumira, Qovixi, and Zaleka sometimes consult Palovo for his wisdom and advice on how to keep balance in the realm.

Palovo loved Lumira.

**Domains:**	Nature, Knowledge

# Qovixi the God of Chaos
----
While some think that Qovixi merely governs lies and deceit, the enlightened understand that mischief, deception, childhood spirit, anger, jealousy, surprise, and laughter are also manifestations of Qovixi's influence. Masters of illusion, performers, jesters, and liars alike prey to the God Qovixi for his aid in their endeavors.

It is said that Qovixi walks the mortal plane more often then any of the other gods. He prefers to manifests as a male halfling or gnome, or a handsome youthful human. Many people prefer to think of Qovixi in the context of humor and cast aside his less desirable traits. Many believe that Qovixi plays a part with every joke ever told.

Qovixi loved Lumira, but Lumira did not love him back.

**Domains:**	Trickery, Tempest

# Zaleka the Goddess of Death
----
Many believe that Zaleka must be evil, however the wise understand that Zaleka is necessary for the circle of life and balance in the realm. Zaleka empowers death, war, decay, darkness, cold, ice, shadows, illness, famine, sadness, and despair. Mothers of fallen children and Merchants of death alike pray for Zaleka's intervention in their times of need, but for very different reasons. The Mother will pray for a quite rest for their child, and the Merchant will pray for famine and darkness to overcome their enemies.

Zaleka brings the dying tree to the ground to make room for Lumira to bring new life to the forest, she brings death to the prey so the predator can eat, and she brings darkness to the realm every night so those who inhabit it can rest.

Zaleka loved Qovixi, but Qovixi did not love her back.

**Domains:**	Death, War
