# Summary

Sybil and her son, Isaac, live in a small cottage a bit south of [[Dragonmouth]]. As a single mom with a gambling problem her life is difficult. She loves her son more than anything and will do anything to keep him safe.

She is under a nerfed [Geas Spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Geas#content) that prevents her from speaking about the beast without taking 1d12 psychic damage.

She will mention the beast on a DC 15 intimidation check.

She will mention the children's books, and her son Isaac will bring out a children's book about [[The Bedlam Beldam]]
