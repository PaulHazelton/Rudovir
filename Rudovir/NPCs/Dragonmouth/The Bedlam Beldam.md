# Description

You see a black four legged figure, antlers nearly as wide as it stands tall, 7 feet, and its face has the skin falling off, revealing it's skull around it's mouth. It's white featureless eyes are the only clearly discernable feature among it's pitch black form. It hauntingly stares at you as it's bloody skeleton jaw opens to speak to you.

>The monster is real, and it was created by and answers to [[Sprinkles Tumtil|Sprinkles]].
