# Description


> [!quote] Description
> A wealthy looking gnome is sat at the table, he's wearing a brightly colored top hat, and a shinny silver cane leaning against the table. He's very happily eating a big bowl of vanilla ice cream that is covered in Sprinkles. Unfortunately, the white color of his beard and mustache does not hide the ice cream dripping on it.
