A large island west of [[Joro]], sometimes called Juni.

The [[Duke Nuged Chamberman]] supposedly rules over Juni, but since he's a bit of a "nug", Juni lies in a state of salutary neglect and is largely independent. The main island is about 100 miles wide and 250 miles long.

Government:
	Type:	Colony of Ezrif
	Duke:	Nuged "Nug/Nugget" Chamberman	(Lives in Clifton)
		A bit of an idiot. Cowardly, lazy, and smells a bit. Nuged Chamberman was appointed by Queen Sylvin to rule Juni. Nuged is very proud of his position, but he is unaware that Queen Sylvin appointed him because she knew he wouldn't do much and would allow Juni to remain largely autonomous. Largely regarded as a harmless idiot with little actual power.
