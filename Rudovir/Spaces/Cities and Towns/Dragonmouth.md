[[Juniper]]

Dragonmouth is a port city in Juniper. It was named for it lying in the mouth of the dragon head that Juniper vaguely resembles, however many now believe it was erroneously named for the stench caused by the [[The Tumtil Paper Mill|paper mill]] which is comparable to that of a dragon's mouth. The main import of the port is straw that is regularly purchased by the lucrative [[The Tumtil Paper Mill]] company.

>[!quote] Description
>You are awoken by the drop of the anchor on the shipping vessel you hitched a ride on as it finally slows. You thought the earthy smell of straw was strong, but it's nothing compared to the overwhelming sulfurous smell of rotten eggs . As you look up you see the modest town of Dragonmouth approaching. Towering over the salty sea, the stone streets, the shops the stores, and the short residents, is a large chimney jutting out from the largest and most profitable business in Dragonmouth, [[The Tumtil Paper Mill]]. As you finish rubbing your watery eyes and gagging over the smell, the gangway is released and you can finally deboard. You instantly feel the sense of sorrow plaguing the city, some folks are seen openly weeping in the street. As you know, there has been a child abduction problem in this city. You are hungry and tired from a long journey, but the pleasant sound of a lute in a nearby tavern is the best greeting you've had so far.
