# Mechanics

## Room

- Half near entrance is in light
- Back half is in shadow
	- Plants can be ignited, or blown down with wind, or pulled down to expose sunlight?
- Tucked in the back behind a corridor, [[Lumira Door Puzzle]].

## Bird with Daylight Moonstone

- Whenever someone screams (or goes into a rage), or a loud noise is herd, or the wall is struck:
	- A flock of birds on the roof fly off and something, vaguely familiar, falls into the dark half of the room and shatters, and light pours out!
	- Now 3 quarters of the room in illuminated.
	- The Daylight Moonstone only has one charge left now after falling.

## Monsters

- 2 [[Shadow]]
- 2 [[Smoke Mephit]]

# After

You see through the window, a haunting looking cave in the distance, with a triangular stone door.
