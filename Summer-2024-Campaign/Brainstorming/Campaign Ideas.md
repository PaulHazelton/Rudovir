# Brainstorming

- Rumpel's needs:
	- Abducted Children for what reason?
		- Maybe he's making them work as wheat farmers lol.
		- Maybe he's sacrificing them so he keeps his power!
	- Lot's of straw so he can turn it in to gold
		- He would have to be buying a lot of straw, turn it into gold, buy more straw, etc.
		- The town is getting a lot of straw imports because Sprinkle is buying it.
		- He is running a paper company, Tumtil Paper Mill.
			- He buys straw, "spins it into yarn", and has it made into textiles.
			- He's making an absolute fortune.
	- She was blackmailed or forced somehow
	- A mysterious figure approached her when she was in a bind.
		- Perhaps this is an actor for [[The Tumtil Paper Mill]]? Maybe that would give away the secret too well.
		- This is someone sent by [[Sprinkles Tumtil|Sprinkles]] in order to frame her, and possibly to mislead the party into the trap. He saw that mysterious character going into that dungeon or something.
