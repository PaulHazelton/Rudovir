When the lever is pulled

> [!quote] Pulling the Lever
> The floor opens up and everything immediately pours into a section below the floor.
> A huge gate behind you closes stopping more water from entering.
> As the water pours into the room, you start to find your footing on a metal grate on the floor, and the water drains below you.

> As soon as the water drains, the ceiling closes above you.
> Now in darkness, the only thing you see is a faint glowing white light, and you hear... giggling?

- She explains how the lever works
	- *You can't use it like a normal lever, that's the trick. You gotta twist it!*
- If they ask how she knows:
	- *I can see through walls, silly!*
- She asks the party to get the ring.
	- *My ring, it's a white stone shaped like a Goose. I'd be so happy if you could bring it to my dad.*
- She explains that the monster doesn't like bright light
	- *It likes the darkness, it hates sunlight and stuff.*
- She advises a short rest
	- *You should be safe in here for a while. The other guy who made it here died when he hit his head on the wall above when the water pushed him into the door.*
- She knows of a secret lever behind a secret door in the room that opens the ceiling again.
	- There is a ladder in the room ready to move to use.
- She stays away from the well room where she died, it scares her.
- She's never seen sprinkles
	- *I was blindfolded after the monster got me and tied me up.*
