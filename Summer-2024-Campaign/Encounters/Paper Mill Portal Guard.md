> You see a humanoid figure leaning against a wall. It appears to be a clockwork mechanism wearing golden armor wielding a sword in it's hand and a crossbow on it's back. Suddenly it's cold mechanical eyes glow yellow as it straightens it's posture and takes a fighting stance.

# Room Descriptions

> [!quote] Portal Room
> As you step through the door you are suddenly hit with the familiar stench of sulfur. The air is a bit warmer and more humid. As you look around you see you are in a room with wooden floors and plaster walls with wooden supports. There is straw messily scattered across the floor, along with some scattered sprinkles. And you see a spinning wheel that would be used to spin yarn or straw. Draped over the wheel is a bit of straw and thin strand of gold on the end.


> [!quote] Vault Room
> This room is quite large, the walls are lined with steel vaults. There is also some food and water stored here, along with some books (clockwork engineering, running a business...) One book is called "How to manipulate people", "Guide to stealth" (found if books are investigated). DC 10 Investigation check reveals that this like a bunker that someone would hide in. DC 20 check reveals secret lower compartment with dragon hoard of gold. There is a large door to exit this area, it will clearly lock behind you and may be difficult open up again.
