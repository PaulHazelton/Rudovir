The party left off at Sybil's house last session.
- They said they would **spend the night**
- Sybil was **charmed** by [[Ebony Lyrathal|Ebony]] using [[Charm Person]]
- While charmed, Sybil said "I'll take you there" referring to [[Hell Well Dungeon|The Dungeon]].
- Isaac showed the party the book about [[The Bedlam Beldam]].

## Sequence of Events

- Sybil's [[Charm Person]] will wear off
- Sybil, upset about the enchanting spell, makes a few things clear
	- "I will NOT let my son out of my sight for any reason."
	- "I will NOT take my son into that forest, I need to keep him safe."

### Player Options for Sybil

- **Agree to go to forest alone**
	- Goblin map shows where the dungeon is
	- Sybil can clearly explain where the dungeon is, just like she told the goblins
- **Want to arrest her** (very bad, Sprinkles wins??)
	- Isaac tells truth and potentially shows evidence
		- Claw marks on Isaac
	- Isaac pleads
		- "Please don't arrest my mommy!"
	- She begs and pleads
	- She fights to the death?
- **Want to go to town for help** (good idea, bad for plot, bad for Sprinkles)
	- Monster Telepathically speaks and reveals itself
		- Threatens kidnapped children
		- Wants party to come to dungeon alone.
	- The party is reminded that they are the adventurers
- **Want to go to Sprinkles for help** (good idea, bad for plot, fine for Sprinkles)
	- Wants them to go after the monster

## Other Notes

- Sybil is still under the Geas spell, if she were to go after the monster, she takes full damage.
