# Ideas

- They fight Sprinkles the mage, then in phase two, Sprinkles the Gold Dragon Wyrmling!
	- Mage version can be the [[Druid]] stat block (CR 2)
- As he turns into a dragon, the floor is destroyed and the players fall in to a massive pit of gold under the paper mill.

## Phase 2

- When Sprinkles is struck down, he melts. The melty liquid turns shinny and golden colored. The melted gold starts combining into a form. Suddenly two large wings of gold lift up out of the puddle of gold. The wings flap with a great wind, and a golden dragon soars up to the ceiling, and just as quickly slams down onto the floor, destroying the ground beneath everyone.
- [[Gold Dragon Wyrmling]]
- All creatures not flying fall 20 feet, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
- The dragon takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the strike.
