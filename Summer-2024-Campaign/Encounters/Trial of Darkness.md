- The room is lit initially by a torch
- A dark room with a mechanism that summons monsters.
	- Smoke Mephits, they might cast dancing lights
- The room must be in complete darkness to stop the machine.
- Needs a riddle or something on the machine

# New Idea

- Blood must go into the bird feeder thing
- Put blood on the machine

# Blinding the Mechanism

- Eye must be covered to stop summoning monsters
	- Eyeball looking rune specifically must be covered
		- Billowing cloak can cover it
		- Soot and mud on the ground can cover it

# Summoning Mechanics

- Start with 1 [[Dust Mephit]]s
- Add additional 1 Mephit per turn until 4 or 5 max have come out.
- Blinding the Mechanism will stop summoning, and open the door.
- After max mephits came out, will summon another one every 5 minutes while mechanism is active
