# Summary

3 bridge trolls sit on a bridge. All 3 in unison sing a quick song, then each one mentions that the players must answer 3 riddles.
- Each riddle correctly answered will cause the ogre that asked it to sit down on the side of the bridge.
- If the players refuse to answer a riddle, or get it wrong 3 times, they will insist that you can't cross the bridge and must go swimming instead.
- They will attack if the players try to cross without solving the riddles.

> We are the bridge trolls, you gotta pay the bridge tolls!
> 3 Riddles you must get, or else, you'll be getting wet!
## River

	- A success will take you further across at half movement speed.
- 30 ft wide river
- A [[Crocodile]] is [[Hiding]], waiting to ambush in the river, 15ft downstream of the bridge.
