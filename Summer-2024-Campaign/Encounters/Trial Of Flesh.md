> After finally making it down the stair case, you walk into a dimly lit hallway, and you hear what sounds like running water. On either side of the water there is a ledge wide enough to walk on.
> 
> After traveling down stream for a while you start to hear a water fall getting louder as you approach.
> 
> In **front** of you the river turns into a waterfall and drops into a dark pit that you can't see the bottom of.
> 
> On the **right**, you see a hallway about 25 feet long that leads to a corner. You smell something strange in that direction.
> 
> As you approach the end of the waterfall, you see:
> On the **left** there is a slot under the wall with water running under that and merging with the main river. As you notice this, you see 3 Crocodiles swim out from under the wall.

> Around the corner you see a cage door that is blocking a small room, coming from that room is the smell of raw meat, it kind of smells like mutton and pork? Above the cage door is a lever, about 12 feet high.
# Crocs

- First, 3 [[Crocodile]]s swim out (from hiding?)
- After 1 is killed, another one may come out (5 total)
- After 1 is fed a lump of meat, the other look toward the feeder.
- A fed croc will retreat peacefully back under the wall with the meat in mouth.

# Meat Cage & Lever

- Lever
	- Lever is 12 feet high, too high to jump
	- Mardnab can be tossed, DC 12 Strength check
	- Rope can be used, DC 12 Athletics
- Pressure Plate
	- After all 6 lumps of meat are removed, pressure plate clicks and water slide transformation happens

> The bloody meat stained section of floor pops up about 2 inches, and you all hear a loud thud, followed by mechanical whirring and whooshing sounds. The sound of the waterfall changes pitch and gets quieter until you can no longer hear it.
> 
> (if in view)
> Large diagonal flooring slides out from the walls in the pit, coming together to form a water slide.

> Y'all have an absolute blast as you go down the waterslide pretty fast, it's a good time.
> After a bit you get to a gentle shallow slope and you can start to stand up again.
