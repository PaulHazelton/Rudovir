# Descriptions and Dialogue

> [!quote] Spotting the Goblins
> You see past the trees a group of 3 goblins, each dragging a tied up child by their tied up wrists across the forest floor. You hear one of the kids starts crying through their rope gag and one of the goblins slaps him in the face shouting "shut the fuck up, kid! Gah I can't wait to be rid of these little shits."

> [!quote] The Hiring
> "We were walking through the forest looking for a nice juicy trading card to rob, when we found something even better! Some lady said she'd just *give* us some gold and all we have to do is go nab some shitty kids!"
# Notes
## These are despicable goblins

Just like how evil and good humans exist, there are evil and good goblins. These goblins are literally human traffickers.
