# [[Sprinkles Tumtil]] is the Mastermind

**Summary:** Sprinkle is hiring and conning people into abducting children for him. This is because he sacrifices children to an [[The Wishing Well|evil well]] in exchange for the power to spin straw into gold.
# The Truth

- A very long time ago, a halfling named [[Sprinkles Tumtil|Rumpelstiltskin]] explored a [[Hell Well Dungeon|very deep cave]].
- At the bottom of the cave, he found a [[The Wishing Well|magic well]].
- The well did not grant wishes, instead it gave the power to turn straw into gold, at the cost of the lives of children.
- Rumpelstiltskin was desperate for gold, and greedy. His curiosity and greed led to him throwing his own child in the well.
- Many years passed, and he abducted many children and threw them into the well to sustain his power.
- Eventually he changed his name to [[Sprinkles Tumtil]] after once being discovered.
- He started a [[The Tumtil Paper Mill|paper company]] so he could obtain a constant supply of straw without raising suspicion.
- He created a [[The Bedlam Beldam]] that he controls, and he weaved the monster into folk-lore so he could blame the missing children on the monster.
- As time went on, Sprinkle needed more and more children to continue growing his wealth.
- After a while, Sprinkle became worried that the town would discover his beast and out him, so he decided to frame [[Sybil Faust|Sybil]].
- The monster tried to steal [[Sybil Faust|Sybil]]'s son Isaac, but it was confronted by Sybil.
- Sybil pleaded with the monster to spare her child, but she had nothing to offer it. The monster agreed to spare her child in exchange for Sybil to abduct children herself and deliver them to the monster.
- Partly out of pity, and partly to allow her to actually deliver the children, the monster gave Sybil some gold.
- Sybil hired [[Dragonmouth Band Of Goblins|goblins]] to kidnap the children for her, because she couldn't bring herself to directly steal the children herself.
