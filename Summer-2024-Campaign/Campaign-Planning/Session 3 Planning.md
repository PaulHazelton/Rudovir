# Thoughts

## Brain Storming
- Hallways, Rooms, And Down-ways
- Motion and Monster
	- The river crocodile idea is pretty good
- Regular melee monsters and archers?
- Some kind of deep pit to descend into?
- A water slide fight
- River challenge in the dungeon?
	- They have to swim up stream while dodging crocodiles?
	- Pull a lever up stream to stop the flow?
- A locked door with a key?
	- Maybe a knowledge key like in Outer Wilds?
	- Maybe an ability key or a puzzle key like a Metroid-Vania?
	- **Bad Idea**, boss door has to be at the bottom!
- Continuous enemy producing thing to shut off
- Coraline children ghosts "the beldam! ahh!"
	- **Goose's Daughter Ghost!**
		- She could request the party get the ring for goose!
		- She could also aide in a short rest

## Ideas
- **Trial of Darkness** (Floor 1)
	- A dark room with a mechanism that summons monsters.
	- The room must be in complete darkness to stop the machine.
	- Needs a riddle or something on the machine
- **[[The Dark Staircase]]**
- **Feed the Crocodiles** (Floor 2)
	- An indoor river leads them to a waterfall
		- Pretty deep but easy to not fall in
	- 3 Crocodiles come out from a grate
		- Maybe 3 more are waiting to come out
		- Players aren't supposed to go through this
	- There is a caged area with 6 large lumps of raw meat
		- Under the meat is a pressure plate, when weight is removed, it clicks
		- When clicked, a water slide appears, and the crocodiles are trained to go back through grate
	- Waterslide takes them to next level
- Waterslide?
- Enclosing Room, Locked Door, False Lever
- **Ghost of Regan** (Floor 3)
	- Locked door and lever? Trick lever that drops them into room with Ghost?
	- Requests ring from well for Goose
	- Short rest opportunity
	- Reveals clue to open final door
	- Does she speak?
		- Yes, but don't reveal sprinkles
		- Calls them Silly Gooses!
- **Shadow Demon Boss Fight** (Bottom Floor)
	- 1 Shadow Demon (maybe find a CR 3?)
	- 1 Smoke Mephits (slightly nerfed?)
	- Maybe no smoke mephits, he's already CR 4

## Keep in Mind
- Think about **Themes**
	- Dealmaking (Sacrifice and bartering)
		- Maybe they have to sacrifice some OP treasure?
	- Darkness and Light
		- Shadows and Smoke
- If you can't see enemy, disadvantage. But if enemy can't see you, attack with advantage, so in complete darkness, normal fighting.
	- Smoke Mephits have darkvision
	- Ebony would be at a disadvantage
- Things to remember
	- This is supposed to be a deep pit that used to be a cave.
		- Descend deep into the dungeon
- Make players feel useful and use odd skills
	- Have a performance thing
	- Have a strength thing
	- Have a small person thing
# Draft 1

- Approach [[Hell Well Dungeon]] door, which opens after reading the inscription.
- Party enters, and door slams shut behind them, plunging them into darkness.
	- Mardnab and Tori have Darkvision
- Perils of the Dungeon
	- At least 2 things, maybe a third, 1 could be short.
- Fight with [[The Bedlam Beldam]]
	- Drops a key to the door behind him.
- Door leads to [[The Wishing Well]] room.
- Another door leads to holding cells
	- The children, along with Isaac, are tied up.
		- Isaac Faust
		- Charley Piebaker
		- Penelope  Piebaker
		- Lucy Smith
- Another door in the holding cell room is a portal that leads to [[The Tumtil Paper Mill]].
