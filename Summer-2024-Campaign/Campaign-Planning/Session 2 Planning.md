# High Level Planning

### What Options Do The Players See?

- Talk to [[Sprinkles Tumtil|Sprinkles]] again.
- Go into [[Bedlam Forest]], go for [[The Bedlam Beldam]].
	- They don't know if it's real, going off shady information. Only Isaac's word.
- Continue to Interrogate [[Sybil Faust|Sybil]], they don't trust her.
- [[Sybil Faust|Sybil]] goes with them into the [[Bedlam Forest]].

### What Do I Want The Players to See?

- [[The Bedlam Beldam]] is definitely real
- [[The Bedlam Beldam]] must be defeated to save the children

### What Does Sprinkles Want?

- To frame Sybil
- The adventurers to "go missing" (die in the dungeon).
- To remain unknown

### How To Correct Players Views?

- To prove [[The Bedlam Beldam|The Monster]]'s existence:
	- It could appear (but must not be killable, and must not wreck the party, be able to escape)
	- It could speak telepathically
- To show the players that [[The Bedlam Beldam|The Monster]] has the children, and make it the target:
	- It could threaten to kill the children it has, taunting the players and letting Sybil go?
	- [[The Bedlam Beldam]] could attack and threaten to kill Isaac
- Sybil won't go with them
	- She flat out refuses when the charm wears off. She won't take her son into the forest and she won't leave his side, so she will not go into the forest.
- They don't trust Sybil
	- [[The Bedlam Beldam|The Monster]] could speak telepathically to the players, taunting them, telling about the children.

# Characters and Motivations

- [[The Bedlam Beldam|The Monster]]
	- Ready to speak telepathically
	- Wants the players to come fight it
	- Wants Sybil to stay behind in her house with her son
- [[Sybil Faust|Sybil]]
	- Protect her son
- Isaac
	- See his friends again
- The Party
	- Save children

# Need To Add / Solve

- Either in the forest, or the dungeon, their must be radiant weapons of some kind.
	- Note: We're in Lumira's domain, the goddess of light.
