[[Session 3 Outline|Session 3]] recap. Our heroes are at the bottom of [[Hell Well Dungeon]], having just rescued Charlie, Penelope, Lucy, and Isaac. There are in the last room at the bottom of the dungeon, and there is one last door.
# Plan

- Take children through door at the bottom of the dungeon.
	- The door is essentially a portal to the inside of [[The Tumtil Paper Mill]]
- [[Paper Mill Portal Guard]] fight in the Portal Room.
- Once outside (or through a window, or heard), they see [[The Show Trial]] happening in the street.
	- Players can exit the paper mill and walk up to the trial, interfering.
	- The players, in possession of the missing children - alive - can easily sway the crowd.
	- Once Sprinkles loses control of the crowd, he teleports away
		- Adrian Moody has an idea of his bunker in the paper mill.
- The players now have to find Sprinkles in his lair, somewhere in the paper mill.
- [[Sprinkles Boss Fight]]
- Reward and conclusion
	- Lots of gold
		- 15,000 Gold
		- Each player can grab about 5,000 gold
	- It seems like the town smells a bit better now.
