> You see what looks like a stone door behind a short corridor and around a corner underneath some still in-tact wooden ceiling, but the edges seem to be part of the wall. There is an intricate carving of the symbol of Lumira (a woman with a sun crown) in the center. There is no handle, instead there are words carved into the stone that read:
> 
> *Illuminate me, Illuminate thee.*

When sunlight is shone on the carved face of Lumira, the edges around the door retreat and the door can be easily pushed open.
