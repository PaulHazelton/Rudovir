# Description

>[!quote] Description
>You are instantly hit with the sickening smell of blood and death. A stone well with a thatch roof sits in the middle of the room. The thatch roof feels strange for an underground well in a cave. The well and the floor around it is covered in blood. On the base of the well is a metal plaque, the words are written in Gnomish.
## The inscription reads:

> *Wishing well, wishing well.
> Take your penny and go to hell.
> Toss in a copper and pray for riches?
> A shoddy deal, I won't grant your wishes.
> Your payment is mild,
> but your wishes are bold?
> Feed me a child,
> and turn your straw into gold.*

# Mechanics

A quartz ring shaped like a goose, which belonged to [[Goose]]'s daughter Regan lies at the bottom of the well.
## Climbing Into the Well

- Sacrificial Soup
	- A character that comes in contact with the fluid at the bottom of the well becomes [[Conditions#Poisoned|poisoned]].
	- While the creature has the fluid on them, they take 1d8 necrotic damage every turn.
	- Cleaning the fluid off of them removes the poison condition.
- It is 30 feet deep (see [[Adventuring Rules#Falling|falling rules]])
- Very dark
- Only one person can fit at a time. A second person entering the well will cause the lower one to fall prone on a failed DC 15 strength saving throw.
- DC 20 Athletics check to climb out without the rope
- DC 13 Strength check to use the crank to pull the person out
