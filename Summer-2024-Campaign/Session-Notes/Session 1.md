- Took job from Sprinkles
- Talked to Connie
- Defeated goblins
	- Put Mind in jail
- Returned children to Connie
- Shopped at Probably Purposeful
- Went to Sybil's house
- Spending the night at Sybil's house

# Ideas

- Use un-nerfed Geas spell to kill Sybil?
- Shadow monsters outside need to fight
- Maybe the monster himself comes to kill Sybil and take Isaac during the fight?

# Big Idea!

- Charm person will wear off
	- Sybil refuses to take her son into the dangerous forest
	- "Let me keep my son safe, please help"
	- Draw a map and explains legend of hell well cave
- Geas will not let her go into forest
- After party leaves, things happen off screen.
	- Isaac gets abducted and taken to dungeon 
	- Sybil is badly wounded
	- Sybil is arrested by guards, led by Sprinkles
- When party returns from dungeon, Sybil is about to be executed, accused of hiring goblins to abduct all the children.
- "Why should we believe you, you're literally just a bunch of girls"

# Improvements

- Less treasure and shop items, takes too much time
	- Fewer treasure items, but better ones.
- Dialogue gets stuck with not revealing info, do better?
- Move quicker and do more encounters?
- More combat with less punishing
	- More, weaker enemies
