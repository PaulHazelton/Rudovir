# Backstory

>Daughter of a high-ranking family with a highly-controlling [[Cypress Lyrathal|father]], an aspiring politician who is not above sacrificing his daughter’s happiness for the sake of the greater good. This character escaped from an arranged marriage and ran away from [[Eckeron|home]] (fleeing the suffocating clutches of an unsupportive family). Navigating the world for the first time on her own, this character quickly runs out of money, and turns to halfway decent tavern performing to support herself. Over time, this halfway decent tavern performing turns to alright tavern performing. Slowly forming a name for herself, this character gets a regular gig at [[The Silly Goose Tavern]], where [[Goose|the elderly owner]] takes pity on her, providing her with a small room in the attic of the tavern and enough hard bread and cheap booze to satiate the rumbling in her belly. Tipsy, angry, and alone, this character relishes in her newfound freedom but can’t help but wonder what more is waiting for her.
