# Backstory

>Grew up in the slums of [[Daggerfist]]. When she was 11, her parents disappeared in the desert to the north, leaving Tori the sole guardian of her 8 year old bedridden brother, [[Flor]] (later takes his first name as her surname). When it became clear that their parents weren’t coming back, Tori abandoned her Infernal name and renamed herself “Protector.” Flor took to calling her “Tori” or “Tor”. Flor is sweet, loving, and gentle, especially loved the wildflowers Tori would pick for him. But he needed expensive potions every day to live. To provide for him, Tori took on menial jobs (stable hand, leatherworker, etc.) when she could and stole when she had to. Normally stole from unruly drunks and bullies. She isn’t stealthy, so she often got caught, and had to fight her way out. Every day, when she left in the morning to find work, she’d tell him to “be good.” One day, when she was about 15, she tried stealing from [[Don|a gangster named Don]]. He caught her, but she won the fight, knocked him out, and escaped. When Don came to, his pride sorely wounded, he vowed vengeance on the tiefling street rat that bested him in a fight. He and his men found her, followed her home, and ambushed her. As a group, they beat her, shouting tiefling slurs, and held her down while they pulled a knife on her brother, who was crying but unable to get out of bed to save his sister. The minute her brother screamed in pain and terror, she fell into her first RAGE. She killed Don and his men, but not before Flor was stabbed in the chest. The medicine couldn’t save him. Departing from this world, Flor’s last words were, “Be good.” From then on, Tori vowed to be a force for good in the world, despite the evil and pain in it. Tori hunted down and killed the rest of Don’s men. After Tori killed a number of men who had regularly abused the women at a brothel, she was hired by [[Madame Lush]] as a bouncer to protect the ladies. Tori has her own room in the brothel. The women treat her like a baby sister and Madame treats her like a stern but loving mother.
