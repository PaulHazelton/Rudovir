There is a staircase with an inscription above the archway leading to it. It leads down to pitch-blackness.

The inscription I like to use is _"Life leads us down dark roads, but sometimes that is necessary to see the light."_ But you can use something else thematic. Alternatively, you can hide this in faint inscriptions down the side of the stairs.

Basically, the stairs are endless until they put out all sources of light. Characters with darkvision must close their eyes. The endless monotony of descending stairs takes its toll after a while, and eventually the PCs will have to start making concentration checks to avoid tumbling down the steps and taking superficial bludgeoning damage. Past a few hours, they might start suffering from temporary levels of exhaustion.

If they turn around, the staircase is endless that way, too.
