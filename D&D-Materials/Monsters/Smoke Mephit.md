# Traits
- **_Death Burst_**. When the mephit dies, it leaves behind a cloud of smoke that fills a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on its space. The sphere is heavily obscured. Wind disperses the cloud, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute.

- **_Innate Spellcasting (1/Day)_**. The mephit can innately cast _[dancing lights](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/sorts.php?vo=dancing-lights)_, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.
# Actions
- **_Claws_**. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit_: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.

- **_Cinder Breath (Recharge 6)_**. The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of smoldering ash. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mephit's next turn.
