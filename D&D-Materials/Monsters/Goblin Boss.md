# Traits
- **_Nimble Escape_**. The goblin can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

- **_Multiattack_**. The goblin makes two attacks with its scimitar. The second attack has disadvantage.
- **_Scimitar_**. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- **_Javelin_**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack_: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. _Hit_: 3 (1d6) piercing damage.
