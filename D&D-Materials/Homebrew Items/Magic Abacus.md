The Abacus
- Seems to be a lot nicer then you would expect to find in a bear cave.
- It has a slight yellow glow in the engravings.
- When the user "asks to know a count or measurement of something", it magically moves the pieces to indicate the number. The pieces will defy gravity and remain in place for 10 minutes.
- The Abacus only works once per day.
